# Copypale
A new way of synchronizing data between anyone with any devices!
See my progress [here](https://github.com/users/noahpy/projects/1).

## My mission
Synchronizing or sharing any kinds of data between diffrent devices can 
be time-consuming and stressful. I want to change this experince by enableing 
an instant, effortless synchronization between any kinds of devices, owned by any kinds of people, with any kinds of data.

### Technical Goals
- Instant Synchronization of the Clipboard
- Instant Synchronization of Images, PDFs and other documents
- Synchronization between different users (Sending and receiving data)
  * Saving users as contacts
- Synchronization between a group of users
  * Forming sharing groups 
  * QR-Code or code for instant subscription of a share

### Nonfunctional Goals
- Effortless, intuitive Interface (less than 4 clicks for every action!)
- Security, Integrity
